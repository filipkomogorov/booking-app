# real-estate-app

A Full-stack app using: React w/ Typescript, Express, Mongo and more.

Created this project to excersize react context, uploading images and working with search in MongoDB.

The app is for a fictional real estate agency, allowing anyone to browse adds, but requires registered and subscribed users in order to view the contact details for each add. 

Admins can view all data and add listings.
